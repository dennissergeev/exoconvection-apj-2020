Code used to process and visualise the model output.
Model data are available upon request (raw data O(100 Gb)).

Notebooks for each individual figure as well as for two data tables are in the [`code/` directory](code), while the figures themselves are in the `plots/` directory.

`page/` directory is for hosting an HTML page with an [interactive version of Fig. 1](https://github.com/dennissergeev/exoconvection-apj-2020).
